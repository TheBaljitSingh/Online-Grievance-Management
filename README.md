## 📌 How It Works  

### **Step 1: Create a Grievance**  
- Log in to your account.  
- Submit a grievance through the system.  

### **Step 2: Track Your Grievance**  
- After submission, you will receive a **tracking number**.  
- Use this tracking number to monitor the status of your grievance.  

### **Step 3: Live Chat with Admin**  
- You can **chat live with the admin** to resolve your grievance.  
- To test this:  
  - Log in as **admin** in one browser.  
  - Log in with a **user account** in another browser.  
- This allows real-time interaction and faster resolution.
